The original SQL statement is solely for creating a new record (INSERT). When using an ORM like Eloquent
there are handy methods like updateOrCreate() but we can accomplish the same thing in SQL using this
statement...

    INSERT INTO tbl1 (id, name)
    VALUES (231, 'Item 231 new value') AS t
    ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE 
        name = t.name;

The primary key is id. If there is no primary key 231 in the table a row with that primary key is created
and the value is set to 'Item 231 new value'. If there is already a row with primary key 231 the name
field is updated with the new value.

We need to add an alias to the first VALUES and reference that when setting the value to update since MySQL
says the old syntax using the VALUES() is being deprecated.

    ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
        name = VALUES(name);

That is all assuming that the question is asking how to INSERT or UPDATE a record. I think it is since the
original statement is an INSERT but if the goal is simply to UPDATE a record this will work...

    UPDATE tbl1
    SET name = 'Item 231 new value'
    WHERE id = 231;
