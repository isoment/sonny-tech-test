In the InformalGreeter class...

    class InformalGreeter extends greeter

Should be...

    class InformalGreeter extends Greeter

The sayHello() method in the InformalGreeter is not compatible with the sayHello() method in the abstract class
since it does not accept a string param with a default value.

Another issue is that we are defining a private property 'target' in Greeter and trying to access it in
InformalGreeter. We should change this to protected.

In index.php we cannot instantiate the Greeter class since it is an abstract class. Instead...

    We can make sayHello() in Greeter an abstract method..

        abstract public function sayHello(string $punctuation = '!');    
    
    And then create a new class FormalGreeter

        class FormalGreeter extends Greeter
        {
            public function sayHello(string $test = '')
            {
                echo 'Hello, ' . $this->target . '!';
            }
        }

    And then call it...

        echo "Greeting {$formalGreeter->getTarget()} ...";
        $formalGreeter->sayHello();
        echo "\n\n\n";

Another issue is here...

    echo "Greeting $informalGreeter->getTarget() ...";

That is not valid syntax, we can use...

    echo "Greeting {$informalGreeter->getTarget()} ...";

The end result is

    Greeting World ...Hello, World! 

    Greeting World ...Hi, World!
