There are several issues in this code, first in the Exam class there is a syntax error...

    return static::defaultText;

Should be...

    return static::$defaultText;

In the index file in the attributes array the 'place' key should use double quotes...

    'place' => "Sonny's"

Also in that same array the 'time' key is calling a now() function but I don't believe this
is valid. We could use date('Y-m-d H:i:s') or if Carbon is installed use that to get the 
current date.

In index.php there is an issue with the following line...

    $exam->score = ;

This property is protected so we cannot assign a value to it but even if it were public this
is not a valid expression.

When we check properties on an instantiated exam object, the __get magic method is called if
the property is inaccessible.

    The first echo... 
    
        echo $exam->time . "\n";

        Will result in the date time being displayed since there is no time property set on
        the object and we set it in the attributes array property through setAttributes()

    The second echo...

        echo $exam->place . "\n";

        Will result in 'office' being displayed since there is a place property on the object
        already and it is public.

    The third echo...

        echo $exam->timeLimit . "\n";

        Will display nothing since there is no timeLimit property on the object and we set it
        in the attributes array property through setAttributes()

    The final echo...

        echo $exam->candidate . "\n";
        
        Will display 'unknown' since there is no candidate property on the object and we are
        not setting it through the getAttributes() method.

It looks like in php 8.0.0+ a warning will be emitted if the __get() magic method is not given
a public access modifier.
