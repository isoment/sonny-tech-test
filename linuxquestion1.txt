If PHP is running in a docker container we can use the following command to search through
the logs using a specific term...

    docker logs <container-id> 2>&1 | grep "specific-error-here"

Containers by default can print logs to stderr and stdout. The above command will redirect both
and allow us to use a pipe and filter with grep. In reality it would be best to setup a central
location where all container logs are stored for a certain time. We could use fluentd and a 
database like mongodb for this.

If the setup is not using docker we can run the following to get the locations where various
errors can be logged...

    php --info | grep error 

It might be possible that PHP logs are being saved by apache, in that case it might be one of these
locations...

    /var/log/apache2/error.log
    /var/log/httpd-error.log

This will all depend on the Linux distro being used. If we want to get the last 1000 lines of the file 
and search a specific term...

    tail -n 1000 /var/log/apache2/error.log | grep "specific-error-here"

    We could also play around with some other flags like -f to follow the end of the log as new entries 
    are added

We could also just search the whole log using...

    grep "specific-error-here" /var/log/apache2/error.log
