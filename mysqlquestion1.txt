From the information provided in the query it is not really clear how tbl3 relates to tbl2. Without
looking at the database we can't know for sure but if we assume that tbl3 has a foreign key linking
it to tbl2 it would look something like this...

    SELECT 
        tbl1.name,
        tbl2.id,
        tbl3.slug
    FROM tbl1
    JOIN tbl2 
        ON tbl2.fk_tbl1_id = tbl1.id
    JOIN tbl3 
        ON tbl3.fk_tbl2_id = tbl2.id
    WHERE tbl2.fk_tbl1_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM tbl3 WHERE name NOT IN ('name1', 'name2'))
    ORDER BY tbl1.name ASC;
